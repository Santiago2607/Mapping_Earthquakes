# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the Project

In this project, we will be helping the Disaster Reporting Network company's team, specifically Basil and Sadhana, to create data visualizations with interactive features about the earthquakes that have happened recently. 
For this task, we decided that Javascript along with GeoJSON, D3, some Mapbox maps through API address, and Leaflet library will be the best match to accomplish a fast and great job. Also, we will be calculating the magnitude, longitude, and latitude of the earthquakes so we can identify their location and put popup markers so people can see where that earthquake is located and its magnitude.

## Results

While working on this project, we decided to create different kinds of earthquake maps such as Street, Satellite, and Dark so people can have a different view of how this information looks. In addition, we created a layered bottom for people to interact with the map and do different changes such as looking for the tectonic plates, all earthquakes, or just the major earthquakes, along with a color differentiation of different magnitudes and a legend explaining to which magnitude each color corresponds, making it easier for people to understand the graph.

1. This first graph shows a street view of all earthquakes with the tectonic plates.

2. Second, we have a graph showing a satellite view of just the earthquakes without the tectonic plates.

3. Finally, we have a graph with a dark view showing only the major earthquakes.
